# DHIS2 Health Indicator Pipeline Project

## üè• Project Overview

The DHIS2 Health Indicator Pipeline is an automated data integration solution that streamlines the collection, processing, and reporting of critical health indicators in Malawi's health information system. This project focuses on HIV/TB indicators and provides a scalable foundation for expanding to other health domains.

### What Problem Does This Solve?

Health facilities and programs often struggle with:
- **Manual data entry** into multiple systems leading to errors and delays
- **Inconsistent reporting** across different data sources
- **Time-consuming processes** for aggregating data from various Excel files and spreadsheets
- **Data quality issues** from multiple manual touch points
- **Delayed reporting** affecting decision-making and program management

### Our Solution

We've created an intelligent automation pipeline that:
- **Automatically extracts** health indicator data from Excel files via SFTP or Google Sheets
- **Validates and processes** the data to ensure quality and consistency
- **Transforms** data into the proper DHIS2 format with intelligent indicator mapping
- **Uploads** processed data directly to DHIS2 through secure APIs
- **Provides monitoring** and error handling for reliable operations

## üîÑ How It Works

### **Data Input Methods**

#### **Method 1: SFTP File Upload** ‚≠ê *Recommended*
1. Health facilities export their data to standardized Excel templates
2. Files are uploaded to a secure SFTP server (automated or manual)
3. System monitors for new files every 15 minutes
4. Files are automatically processed when detected

#### **Method 2: Google Sheets Integration**
1. Facilities update data in shared Google Sheets
2. Changes trigger automatic processing via webhooks
3. Real-time data synchronization to DHIS2
4. Collaborative editing with proper access controls

### **Processing Pipeline**

```
üìÑ Excel/Sheets ‚Üí üîç Validation ‚Üí üîÑ Transformation ‚Üí üìä DHIS2 ‚Üí üìà Reports
```

1. **Data Extraction**: Intelligent parsing of Excel files or Google Sheets data
2. **Validation**: Automated checks for data completeness, format, and business rules
3. **Mapping**: Smart matching of indicator names to DHIS2 data elements
4. **Transformation**: Conversion to DHIS2 dataValueSets format
5. **Upload**: Secure API submission to DHIS2 instance
6. **Verification**: Confirmation of successful data import
